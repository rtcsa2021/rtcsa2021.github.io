<p>The RTCSA conference series (now at its 27th edition) brings together
researchers and developers from academia and industry for advancing the
technology and the theory to design and develop time-sensitive applications.
All traditional applications in which temporal aspects need to be considered
are in the scope of the conference. CPS, (Industrial) IoT, embedded systems,
fog/edge/cloud computing are just notable examples. RTCSA welcomes both
research and industrial papers that describe research or technical aspects in
the area of embedded and real-time systems. Proceedings will be published by
the IEEE Computer Society on IEEExplore and will be indexed by most search
engines including Scopus, Web of Science, DBLP. </p>

<p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper
be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the
conference to present the work. RTCSA 2021 reserves the right to exclude a
paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital
library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the
conference. </p>

<h2>Topic of Interest</h2>

<p>The 27th edition of RTCSA will bring together researchers and developers from
academia and industry to promote cross-fertilization and discuss advances and
trends in the technology of embedded and real-time systems and their emerging
applications, including the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems.
RTCSA 2021 seeks papers that describe original research in the following areas,
but are not limited to:</p>

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must
describe original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted
elsewhere. We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two
formats:</p>

<p>Full Paper format: paper must fit within 10 pages</p>
<p>Short Paper format: paper must fit within 6 pages</p>

<p>Both types of submission must be formatted according to the IEEE conference
proceedings format (two-columns, single-space, 10pt) and must include
references and acknowledgements within the page limit. </p>

<p>In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper
submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to
reduce its length for the final version. Conference content will be published
by the IEEE Computer Society on IEEExplore and will be indexed by most search
engines including Scopus, Web of Science, DBLP. </p>

<p>By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will
register at full registration rate to the conference and present the paper (in
person or via a teleconferencing system).</p>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>

<p>The diffusion of COVID-19 (“coronavirus”) is constantly monitored by
the conference organizers.  Since safety of participants is of paramount
importance to the organizers, would the infection pose a threat to participants
according to the WHO, we will allow speakers the remote presentation via a
video-conferencing system.</p>
