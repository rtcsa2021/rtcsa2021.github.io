			    <p align="justify">Over the last few decades, data center (DC) technology has evolved from DC 1.0 (tightly-coupled silos) to DC 2.0 (computer virtualization) in order to enhance data processing capability. In the era of big data, highly diversified analytics applications stress data centers. The mounting requirements on throughput, resource utilization, manageability and energy efficiency demand seamless integration of heterogeneous system resources to adapt to varied big data applications, for which DC 2.0 does not suffice. By rethinking the challenges of big data applications, Huawei proposes a High Throughput Computing Data Center architecture (HTC-DC) toward the design of DC 3.0. HTC-DC features resource disaggregation via unified interconnection. It offers PB-level data processing capability, intelligent manageability, high scalability and high energy efficiency, hence a promising candidate for DC 3.0.</p>

		        <p align="justify">Dr.<strong> Jeff Hao</strong> is a technical director in Shannon lab, Huawei Corporate Research. He is member of IEEE computer society, photonics society, and senior member of china  computer society. His research interest  include computer architecture, high performance  computer and optical interconnect. Dr. Qinfen Hao graduated from institute of computing technology, Chinese academy of science in 2001. then he  entered into Lenovo group , there he  set up lenovo’s high performance server division and  developed first  high performance   computer with speed  teraflops in china.then he went to huawei  to attend   a  high end server project . He lead this high end server design work and change the prototype into product . This server project  achieved  business success and promote huawei’s  server business greatly. In 2012, he changed his work area into optical interconnect next generation computer ,which is a very hot research topic now. He was appointed to staff member of china high –tech plan(863)  expert committee from 2008 to 2012, and was co-chair in several international conference such as  Ieee optical interconnect  conference.</p>
