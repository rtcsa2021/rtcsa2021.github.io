			    <p>Modern cars have 50-100 electronic control units (ECUs) that are connected by a complex communication network using CAN, FlexRay and Ethernet and several gateways. Such a platform is used to support various control applications ranging over safety-critical, driver assistance and comfort-related functions. In such a setup, traditional control theoretic techniques -- where control engineers are only concerned with high-level plant and controller models and abstract away platform-specific implementation details like numerical precision, computation times and message communication delays -- suffer from a number of problems.<br />
			      In particular, in such cases model-level semantics and control performance deviates significantly from what is seen after the implementation. In order to close this gap, a considerable effort is spent on integration, testing and debugging which significantly increases the development cost and poses an obstacle towards certification.<br />
			      The goal of this tutorial is to highlight these problems and present approaches currently being developed in the area of cyber-physical systems towards co-design of control algorithms and their implementation platforms. In particular we will discuss techniques for communication, computation and memory-aware controller design, along with techniques for controller synthesis from formal specifications.<br />
		        Target audience: This tutorial is targeted towards an audience with a background in real-time and embedded systems. No previous experience in automotive systems or control theory will be assumed.</p>

		          Technical University of Munich, where the holds the Chair for Real-Time 
		          Computer Systems. He also leads a research program on embedded systems 
		          design for electric vehicles at the TUM CREATE Centre for 
		          Electromobility in Singapore, where he serves as a Scientific Advisor. 
		          Prior to joining TU Munich in 2008, he was an Assistant Professor of 
		          Computer Science at the National University of Singapore from 2003 -
		          2008.  He obtained his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from 
		          ETH Zurich in 2003. He has published over 150 conference and journal 
		          articles on various aspects of embedded systems and software design and 
		          has/had several funded projects from the industry such as from General 
		          Motors, BMW, Bosch, Siemens and Audi, as well as from government funding 
		          agencies both in Germany as well as in Singapore. He was the General 
		          Chair of the Embedded Systems Week (ESWeek) 2011, and the Program Chair 
		          of EMSOFT 2009 and SIES 2012, and regularly serves on the TPCs of many 
		          conferences on real-time and embedded systems. For his Ph.D. thesis, he 
		          received the ETH Medal and the European Design and Automation 
		          Association's Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2004. In 2012, 
		          he was also awarded the Best PhD Thesis Award from the National Centres 
		          of Competence in Research in Switzerland (NCCR) for contributions to the 
		          Mobile Communications &amp; Information Systems (MICS) project that ran from 
		          2001 – 2012, and in which he was employed during his doctoral studies. 
		          In addition, he has received Best Paper Awards in ASP-DAC 2011 and EUC 
		          2010 and several Best Paper Award nominations at RTSS, EMSOFT, 
		          CODES+ISSS, ECRTS and DAC.<br />
